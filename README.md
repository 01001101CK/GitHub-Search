## Description:
This application will provide a convenient and organized way for individuals or organizations to access and view member profiles on GitHub. The pagination feature will make it easier to navigate through large amounts of data in a user-friendly way. 

## Local Development
After cloning the repo to your local machine, from the directory cloned inside of your terminal, run:

npm install

Run the project by using the command below.

npm run dev 

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:5174/ to view it in the browser.


## Component based design
The design of the application was done using the component-based approach which allows for easy management and efficient updates to the state of the application.

## Styling 
Styling is a crucial aspect of the application and it was achieved by using a combination of CSS and Styled-Components. By tying the styles to specific components, it makes it easier to maintain and understand the styling of the application.

## Promise-based design pattern
I used Axios to enhance the user experience by allowing the application to retrieve and display updated information in real-time, without the need for a page refresh. This creates a more dynamic, interactive and better experience for the user.

## Strong typing
For enhanced understanding and error control, I utilized TypeScript. 

## Languages And Tools:
This project was built utilizing a combination of React, Typescript, Styled-Components, Axios and Vite.
